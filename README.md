## conclusion 
The motive of the project is to aid the front-line workers and ensure that patient care remains in excellent condition. In the midst of this pandemic, the most important safety measures are social distancing along with proper sanitization. However, due to the lack of existing technological methods for monitoring these safety measures, human intervention became necessary.
